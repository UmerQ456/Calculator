# Calculator
This was an attempt to create a simple, firsttime project using the F# programming language. It all started with my desire to learn a new language that prioritizes both type safety and readability. It takes in user input which must be a number from 1-4 to prompt the user to perform a calculation or quit the app.

You will find 2/3 failed attempts to make this calculator which only made use of functions. The 3rd attempt though - Program2.fs, taught me to use classes called 'types' in F# which seemed to do the job.
